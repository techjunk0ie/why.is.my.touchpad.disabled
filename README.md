## How to disable or enable the touchpad on a laptop

The touchpad on a laptop is a convenient way to add the functionality of a mouse without needing an extra peripheral. When the touchpad is enabled or unlocked, the touchpad has the same functionality as an external mouse. When the touchpad is disabled or locked, the touchpad doesn't work, preventing the mouse cursor's accidental movement with your palm while typing. When disabled, the need for an external mouse is required.

The exact steps to enable or disable the touchpad may differ slightly, depending on the laptop's manufacturer, so you may need to use some intuition to achieve your desired outcome.
